    # Welcome 👋


    Using the REST API allows you to programmatically execute a wide range of
    code operations which are also available through the user interface. In this
    guide you will find a quick start section with the most important concepts
    about the API, instructions to authenticate and some short code examples.


    ## **Quick start**


    There are a few [key
    concepts](https://developers.sendinblue.com/docs/how-it-works) to keep in
    mind while using our API:


    - [**Rate limits**](https://developers.sendinblue.com/docs/api-limits)
    **and** [**platform
    quotas**](https://developers.sendinblue.com/docs/platform-quotas)

    - How to call the
    [**endpoints**](https://developers.sendinblue.com/docs/how-it-works#endpoints)

    - What is the [**response
    structure**](https://developers.sendinblue.com/docs/how-it-works#responses)

    - What [**API SDKs**](https://developers.sendinblue.com/docs/api-clients)
    you can use depending on your stack

    - What [**IP
    addresses**](https://developers.sendinblue.com/docs/how-it-works#sendinblue-ip-addresses)
    we use
